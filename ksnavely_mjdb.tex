% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}

  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.


% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

The Majorana parts tracking database is a software effort with the goal of tracking
cosmogenic activation in materials and parts used by the Majorana collaboration. The
Majorana Demonstrator is an R\&D proof of concept leading towards a tonne-scale Germanium
neutrinoless double beta decay experiment. Neutrinoless double beta decay is an exceedingly
rare process requiring extreme radiopurity of components used in the experiment's
construction. Tracking the location of parts as they are produced provides an estimate
of their exposure to activating cosmic radiation. A web application for data entry
and a Python exposure calculator have been developed to be used as a tool for
achieving the extreme radiopurity required by such a rare decay search.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} well know $\beta$ decay process, in which a neutron decays into
a proton with the emission of an electron (\elec) and electron 
anti-neutrino (\elanu), is energetically forbidden for some even-even
nuclei. However, double beta decay modes such as two neutrino beta decay (\tnbb)
 or neutrinoless double beta decay (\znbb) may be allowed.
\tnbb\ is a well know process REF however observations of \znbb\ remain highly
controversial at best REF. 

The Majorana experiment is located at the 4850' level of the Sanford Underground
Research Laboratory (SURF), and uses high-purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors enriched in
\enrGe\ as both a source and detector for \znbb. Majorana is using a modular
detector design and multiple experiment phases leading to a tonne-scale Germanium
detector array. The prototype is nearly completion, the Demonstrator has begun
production, and the tonne-scale effort is being researched together with the GERDA 
collaboration, in Gran Sasso, Italy.

Majorana's choice of detection technology, high-radiopurity components, and deep-underground
location make it a prime candidate for detection of dark matter candidates known as weakly
interacting massive particles. It is known that dark matter comprises 26.8\% of all energy
in the universe, and yet the composition of dark matter is as of yet undertermined. The
Majorana Prototype and Demonstrator should probe to blah blah some limit REF.

One part of Majorana's radiopurity campaign is a comprehensive parts tracking effort. Cosmic
radiation may activate unstable isotopes in detector components which may later decay, and 
tracking the activation rate of these cosmogenic isotopes allows for an estimate of background
radiation due to activated detector components. Majorana has developed a CouchDB based database
for tracking parts used in the construction of the experiment, with a web-application frontend
for data entry and a Python based exposure calculator. Storage and transportation history are
converted into geocodes and the time and elevation information can be used to place an limit
on activated materials.

\subsection{Majorana}
\subsubsection{Neutrinoless double beta decay and dark matter}
Neutrinoless double beta decay would imply that the neutrino is a Majorana fermion (it is its own
antiparticle), and that lepton number is not a conserved quantity. 
The half life (or decay rate) of this process, \Tznbb, is also
related to the effective Majorana mass of the neutrino, and may
provide insight into the mass hiearchy of the neutrino family.

In double beta decay modes, two neutrons are converted to protons
simultaneosly. \tnbb\ results in the emission of two \elec\ and \elanu, and
in \znbb\ only the two electrons escape. \znbb\ therefore implies the pair
annihilation of the \elanu\ and therefore that the \elanu\ is its own
antiparticle, \elnu.

Neutrinoless double beta decay, if it exists, is an exceedingly rare
process. Because the \elanu's annihilate, only the electrons escape
the decay. The resulting signal is a sharp peak at the endpoint of the
conventional \tnbb\ spectrum. Detecting this signal will require extremely
low background radiation, driving many \znbb\ deep underground. In addition,
extremely radiopure materials must be used for construction of the detector
components.


In addition to neutrino science, Majorana offers the possibility of exploring dark
matter candidates. It is known that luminous matter (matter coupling strongly to electromagnetism) 
cannot account for the gravitational matter observed in the universe. Galactic rotation
velocities, cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy, and gravitational lensing by
galactic clusters all support this idea. Recent results from the Plank mission
demonstrate that the universe is composed of 4.9\% luminous matter, 26.8\% dark matter,
and 68.3\% dark energy.

It has been found that dark matter plays a vital role in the evolution of the universe,
and is key to the discrete structure of galaxies and other bodies of the cosmos we observe
today.
Because dark matter by definition does not significantly interact via electromagnetism,
conventional observational astronomy cannot detect its presence. Its existence must be
inferred from gravitational observation, and dark matter's composition is not yet known.
Baryonic matter, that which is made up primarly of three-quark
baryons by mass, is not believed to be a majority dark matter candidate due to estimates
from Big Bang nucleosynthesis, searches for large lensing objects, and analysis of the
CMB anisotropy.
The leading candidates for the majority of dark matter in the universe are Weakly
Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which couple non-trivially only to gravitation
and the weak force.

WIMPs belong to the category of dark matter known as Cold Dark Matter (CDM), refering
to non-relativistic particles. There are no known particles which fufill the role of
WIMP dark matter, however, WIMP-like particles do appear in extensions the the standard
model such as supersymmetry. The Majorana collaboration's choice of high purity Germanium (HPGe)
detectors allow a competitive measurement campaign for CDM WIMPs.

\subsection{Web Applications and CouchDB}
As both client computers and data-serving cloud power grows, the web browser has grown as a
platform for application development in of itself. Users can execute software natively without
the need for code management and compiling, and technologies proven on the web such as HTML
and Javascript can provide a graphical user interface and interactivity without the need
for complicated third party libraries. 

Applications which run in the browser and communicate using the HTTP Representational State Transfer
(REST) model can easily communicate with powerful database interfaces which also speak HTTP, such as
CouchDB. CouchDB is a "No SQL" document based database, and powerful services such as Cloudant wrap
distributed CouchDB instances together providing a Cloud model for data storage. Database management
is minimized with a data layer such as Cloudant and developers can focus on creating client applications.

\subsubsection{Web Apps}
Majorana has choosen the Cloudant data layer for data storage and developed a Javascript web application
for parts tracking data entry. The Majorana Parts Tracking Database (PTDB) leverages the Backbone.js
framework to supply a Model-View-Collection (MVC) decomposition and is currently used by over blah blah
collaboration members, tracking blah blah parts and blah history entries.

The MVC design pattern (also known as Model-View-Controller and closely related to other patterns) breaks
down the component objects in an application into three areas of concern. The Model objects contain 
the data being manipulated as well as logic dealing with that data. The Views provide an interface for
displaying the model data to the user, as well as logic dealing with the representation of data. 
Collections (or Controllers) aggregate the models as well as contain inter-model logic.

In this fashion, a model is not concerned with what type of view(s) it may have, and a view may 
not directly manipulate the model it represents. Instead, message/event passing is used and allows
the views to notify the collection when some operation must be done on model objects. This decouples
the data and presentation layer of the application is a proven architectual pattern for web development.

Backbone.js provides the base Model, View, and Collection objects and supplies them with a powerful API.
In addition, the Backbone.Events API can be extended to any object and provides a message passing interface
which can be in lieu of a custom event layer. Backbone.js was designed with CouchDB in mind and is
a great starting point for CouchDB based application development.

\section{Parts Tracking}
Into to parts tracking

\subsection{Why Track Parts}
Why

\subsubsection{Exposure Calculation}
A direct link to the physics goals of Majorana. Provide an estimate of cosmogenic activity in a part based on its material, storage, and travel history.

\subsubsection{Inventory and Tracking}
A significant task for any organization with a large number of physical assets. A single interface for tracking most items of interest is an invaluable tool. What processes has an item undergone? Where was it stored an how long?

\subsubsection{Web Apps}
A web interface provides an easy-to-use bridge for entering data into or presenting data from a database. A web interface is available anywhere with an internet connection. No coding is required on the end-user's behalf, no application must be compiled/supported on user machines, and code updates are a page-refresh away.

\subsection{What are we tracking}
Intro what. Serial number engraving, labeling.

\subsubsection{Storage and Transportation}
These are turned from addresses/times into geocodes (lat, long, elev, time)

\subsubsection{Processes}
A number of different processes an item can undergo; some have MJ \#s.

\subsubsection{Relatives and Materials}
Important for radiopurity. If there exists a hot part, we want to know from which stock it came from. Material differences are very important especially for electroformed v. commercial copper.

\subsubsection{Assemblies and Components}
As complex mechanical systems are built from MJ parts, we must track the location of individual members of the mechanical assembly. For instance, if a hot part is suspected, simulation data combined with assembly information can shorten repair/replacement downtime.

\subsection{How are we tracking}

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
