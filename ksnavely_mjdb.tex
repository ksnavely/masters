% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.

% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.

  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/

% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/

% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.


% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

The Majorana parts tracking database is a software effort with the goal of tracking
cosmogenic activation in materials and parts used by the Majorana collaboration. The
Majorana Demonstrator is an R\&D proof of concept leading towards a tonne-scale Germanium
neutrinoless double beta decay experiment. Neutrinoless double beta decay is an exceedingly
rare process requiring extreme radiopurity of components used in the experiment's
construction. Tracking the location of parts as they are produced provides an estimate
of their exposure to activating cosmic radiation. A web application for data entry
and a Python exposure calculator have been developed to be used as a tool for
achieving the extreme radiopurity required by such a rare decay search.

\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} well know $\beta$ decay process, in which a neutron decays into
a proton with the emission of an electron (\elec) and electron 
anti-neutrino (\elanu), is energetically forbidden for some even-even
nuclei. However, double beta decay modes such as two neutrino beta decay (\tnbb)
 or neutrinoless double beta decay (\znbb) may be allowed.
\tnbb\ is a well know process REF however observations of \znbb\ remain highly
controversial at best REF. 

The Majorana experiment is located at the 4850' level of the Sanford Underground
Research Laboratory (SURF), and uses high-purity Germanium (HPGe) detectors enriched in
\enrGe\ as both a source and detector for \znbb. Majorana is using a modular
detector design and multiple experiment phases leading to a tonne-scale Germanium
detector array. The prototype is nearly completion, the Demonstrator has begun
production, and the tonne-scale effort is being researched together with the GERDA 
collaboration, in Gran Sasso, Italy.

Majorana's choice of detection technology, high-radiopurity components, and deep-underground
location make it a prime candidate for detection of dark matter candidates known as weakly
interacting massive particles. It is known that dark matter comprises 26.8\% of all energy
in the universe, and yet the composition of dark matter is as of yet undertermined. The
Majorana Prototype and Demonstrator should probe to blah blah some limit REF.

One part of Majorana's radiopurity campaign is a comprehensive parts tracking effort. Cosmic
radiation may activate unstable isotopes in detector components which may later decay, and 
tracking the activation rate of these cosmogenic isotopes allows for an estimate of background
radiation due to activated detector components. Majorana has developed a CouchDB based database
for tracking parts used in the construction of the experiment, with a web-application frontend
for data entry and a Python based exposure calculator. Storage and transportation history are
converted into geocodes and the time and elevation information can be used to place an limit
on activated materials.

\subsection{Majorana}
\subsubsection{Neutrinoless double beta decay and dark matter}
Neutrinoless double beta decay would imply that the neutrino is a Majorana fermion (it is its own
antiparticle), and that lepton number is not a conserved quantity. 
The half life (or decay rate) of this process, \Tznbb, is also
related to the effective Majorana mass of the neutrino, and may
provide insight into the mass hiearchy of the neutrino family.

In double beta decay modes, two neutrons are converted to protons
simultaneosly. \tnbb\ results in the emission of two \elec\ and \elanu, and
in \znbb\ only the two electrons escape. \znbb\ therefore implies the pair
annihilation of the \elanu\ and therefore that the \elanu\ is its own
antiparticle, \elnu.

Neutrinoless double beta decay, if it exists, is an exceedingly rare
process. Because the \elanu's annihilate, only the electrons escape
the decay. The resulting signal is a sharp peak at the endpoint of the
conventional \tnbb\ spectrum. Detecting this signal will require extremely
low background radiation, driving many \znbb\ deep underground. In addition,
extremely radiopure materials must be used for construction of the detector
components.


In addition to neutrino science, Majorana offers the possibility of exploring dark
matter candidates. It is known that luminous matter (matter coupling strongly to electromagnetism) 
cannot account for the gravitational matter observed in the universe. Galactic rotation
velocities, cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy, and gravitational lensing by
galactic clusters all support this idea. Recent results from the Plank mission
demonstrate that the universe is composed of 4.9\% luminous matter, 26.8\% dark matter,
and 68.3\% dark energy.

It has been found that dark matter plays a vital role in the evolution of the universe,
and is key to the discrete structure of galaxies and other bodies of the cosmos we observe
today.
Because dark matter by definition does not significantly interact via electromagnetism,
conventional observational astronomy cannot detect its presence. Its existence must be
inferred from gravitational observation, and dark matter's composition is not yet known.
Baryonic matter, that which is made up primarly of three-quark
baryons by mass, is not believed to be a majority dark matter candidate due to estimates
from Big Bang nucleosynthesis, searches for large lensing objects, and analysis of the
CMB anisotropy.
The leading candidates for the majority of dark matter in the universe are Weakly
Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), which couple non-trivially only to gravitation
and the weak force.

WIMPs belong to the category of dark matter known as Cold Dark Matter (CDM), refering
to non-relativistic particles. There are no known particles which fufill the role of
WIMP dark matter, however, WIMP-like particles do appear in extensions the the standard
model such as supersymmetry. The Majorana collaboration's choice of high purity Germanium (HPGe)
detectors allow a competitive measurement campaign for CDM WIMPs.

\subsection{Web Applications and CouchDB}
As both client computers and data-serving cloud power grows, the web browser has grown as a
platform for application development in of itself. Users can execute software natively without
the need for code management and compiling, and technologies proven on the web such as HTML
and Javascript can provide a graphical user interface and interactivity without the need
for complicated third party libraries. 

Applications which run in the browser and communicate using the HTTP Representational State Transfer
(REST) model can easily communicate with powerful database interfaces which also speak HTTP, such as
CouchDB. CouchDB is a "No SQL" document based database, and powerful services such as Cloudant wrap
distributed CouchDB instances together providing a Cloud model for data storage. Database management
is minimized with a data layer such as Cloudant and developers can focus on creating client applications.

\subsubsection{Web Apps}
Majorana has choosen the Cloudant data layer for data storage and developed a Javascript web application
for parts tracking data entry. The Majorana Parts Tracking Database (PTDB) leverages the Backbone.js
framework to supply a Model-View-Collection (MVC) decomposition and is currently used by over blah blah
collaboration members, tracking blah blah parts and blah history entries.

The MVC design pattern (also known as Model-View-Controller and closely related to other patterns) breaks
down the component objects in an application into three areas of concern. The Model objects contain 
the data being manipulated as well as logic dealing with that data. The Views provide an interface for
displaying the model data to the user, as well as logic dealing with the representation of data. 
Collections (or Controllers) aggregate the models as well as contain inter-model logic.

In this fashion, a model is not concerned with what type of view(s) it may have, and a view may 
not directly manipulate the model it represents. Instead, message/event passing is used and allows
the views to notify the collection when some operation must be done on model objects. This decouples
the data and presentation layer of the application is a proven architectual pattern for web development.

Backbone.js provides the base Model, View, and Collection objects and supplies them with a powerful API.
In addition, the Backbone.Events API can be extended to any object and provides a message passing interface
which can be used in lieu of a custom event layer. Backbone.js was designed with CouchDB in mind and is
a great starting point for CouchDB based application development.

\subsubsection{CouchDB and Cloudant}
CouchDB stores database records as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) documents. JSON provides a human-readable
standard for data representation which is a subset of JavaScript syntax. Data is represented as an object
literal which maps key strings to values, which may be strings, numbers, arrays, or other object literals. 
JSON parses naturally into JavaScript objects and other languages, such as Python, have easy to use
JSON parsing libraries. Working with a JSON object is very similar to interaction with hash-maps or 
dictionaries in Python.

Accessing the JSON documents in a Couch database is done via HTTP/REST. The REST model prescribes a client-server
relationship in which state (database records for instance) is requested through an interface.
HTTP is the interface of the web and interactions with CouchDB are handled with HTTP
requests such as GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE. Document identity is specified with a Universal Resource Identifier (URI)
and Universal Resource Locator (URL).

Besides directly requesting a document at a given URI, CouchDB takes advantage of the MapReduce paradigm for data
queries. MapReduce is an approach which optimizes a given query for parallel/cluster computing. First a map function
is defined which is applied to all of the data in the database. It filters and sorts documents and returns key-value
pairs. For instance, we may wish to return all database documents of some type, with a specific attribute used as
a key to access the filtered documents. The map step performs logical comparisons on the database records and
returns a key and value.

The reduce step takes the output of the map function and summarizes the result. Rather than returning a dictionary
of key-value pairs, it returns a single value from an operation performed on the result from the map step. The reduce
step is optional and not all queries will require one. MapReduce is implemented in CouchDB with view documents. Each has
a map and reduce JavaScript function, and only the map function is required. View results are updated incrementally as
documents change or are added to the database and results are cached. In this way, view result rebuilds do not require
long wait times as in other MapReduce implementations (such as REF).

Updates to documents stored in CouchDB are handled through a multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). Using MVCC
circumvents the needs for file locks while writing to the database. Rather than locking a database record during
a write operation, the current version is marked as expired and a new version of the file is is created. When a 
record is requested, the latest version is sent to the user, although older versions may be requested as well.
They are differentiated by a revision number, and a revision number is required when writing a document back 
to the database. If the revision number of the document to be written does not match the number in the database a 
document confict occurs and it is left to the application to resolve the conflict. This allows database interactions
to scale to large numbers of concurrent readers and writers.

\section{Parts Tracking Overview}
To uniquely identify parts and stock used by Majorana a serial number is laser engraved into metal and plastic parts.
Some parts are too large to be easily engraved, or are otherwise unsuitable for laser engraving, and these
components can be identified through metal stamping, affixing labels, or organizing a set of identical parts
with a common provienience in a bag and detailing the information on the bag.

Detecting ultra-rare processes like neutrinoless double beta decay or dark matter interactions with nuclei requires
Majorana to push the limits of experimental cleanliness and materials radiopurity. One source of background that
must be accounted for is radiation from unstable cosmogenic isotopes. These isotopes are activated in otherwise
radiopure materials by exposure to cosmic radiation. 

If the elevation and shielding of experimental components
can be tracked over time an estimate can be provided for cosmogenic activation rates. This will allow Majorana
to red-flag parts which may be hot, or allow for detailed investigation of part history if a source of background
is found within the experiment.

Addresses of travel and storage points are stored in a document in Majorana's PTDB and storage and transportation history
entries reference these locations. Majorana's exposure calculation software uses the Google Maps APIs to geocode these
locations and provide sample travel route information. The geocodes include elevation information and the elevation v. time
profile is used to calculate an estimate for activation rates of cosmogenic isotopes in tracked components.

In addition to physics information provided by tracking material exposure to cosmic radiation, parts tracking also provides
a great logistical benefit to Majorana. Organizing and tracking information about thousands of components is a logistics
challenge faced by many organizations or businesses. Providing a web interface for data entry and retrieval allows
a non-expert user to interface with data stored in Majorana's CouchDB. Any web browser becomes a tool which can
be used to query information about part location or history.

Components used by Majorana go through many processes. Cleaning, for instance, is a complicated task for an ultra-low
background experiment. There are many different cleaning processes a part may undergo and part's cleaning history
must be understood before integration into detector hardware. History entries stored with part records in the PTDB
allow scientists to verify whether a part has been acid etched, ultrasonic cleaned, or wiped with ethanol/isopropanol,
a task which is unsuitable for the human eye.

Other processes, such as machinging, irreversibly change a part's structure. Many fine, subtle details may differentiate
two otherwise very similar looking parts. Tracking the machining date, machinst, and Majorana drawing number allow
for ambiguities to be resolved when a component's history is called into question. Because Majorana electroforms its
own copper, manufacturing steps like steel mandrel resurfacing, seperation of copper from mandrels, or intermediate
copper machining is also tracked.

There are many other process types such as the acid leaching of plastics or electron beam welding. Not every type can
be accounted for in application development and CouchDB's document based data flexibility is exploited by the ability
to easily add process types directly from the user interface. Some processes require official Majorana procedure to be
followed and entry of the Majorana procedure number is required.

Majorana manufactures its own detector components deep underground in its clean machine shop, and tracking the natural
flow of stock material to finished parts is an important part of the PTDB. This is especially important in the case of
copper, as there must be no question as to whether a copper component is machined from commercial copper stock or
Majorana's own ultra-pure underground electroformed copper. Thus, the stock and part relationship is also tracked using
the PTDB web interface. 

When a stock-part relationship is established (known generally as parent-child), the child inherits the parent records
material type. The bulk of the mass of Majorana's components is copper, though steel, teflon, and other plastics are 
present in smaller amounts. Electromformed copper is basically indistinguishable from commercial copper and so material
tracking is vital.

The parent-child relationship is strictly one to many. No part can have more than one parent, as the parent-child link
represents a reducing process, such as maching parts or cutting cables. A part which is made from more than one individual
component is known as an assembly and the PTDB handles such relationships. A part can be only a member of one assembly,
although an assembly may be a component of another assembly, known as that assembly's parent assembly.

The assembly types in Majorana are drawn directly from the project engineering's CAD designs and represent logical 
groupings of parts, such as Detector Units, Detector Strings, or Cryostats. For instance, a hollow hex rod, which is much like
a custom copper bolt, is a component of a Detector Unit assembly. When multiple identicle parts are present in an assembly,
each part is assigned a role number which correlates directly to simulation geometry designed by Majorana. 

By assigning each part and indivdual position number abberat backgrounds can be examined through a positional analysis in 
simulation and the radioactive part identified without immediate deconstruction of an assembly which is very costly in 
terms of manpower and time. During construction of detector components, detailed notes are kept in physical logbooks which
are transcribed electronically, and finally the assembly information is entered into the PTDB.

Given a serial number, one can examine a part in the PTDB and walk up the assembly tree. The hollow hex rod is a member
of a Detector Unit, which is a member of a Detector String, which is in turn a component of a Cryostat assembly. Furthermore,
if a history entry is applied to an assembly, it is also applied to each component or sub\-assembly in the assembly tree. If a Cryostat recieves
a transportation history entry, each String, Detector Unit, and hollow hex rod in the tree will recieve the same entry.

\subsubsection{tools used}
Many web applications adopt what is known as a model-view-controller (MVC) decomposition
as a strategy for application structure. This approach seperates the data objects from
their representation. In the web environment this is a natural strategy as view information
may deal with HTML and CSS, which are entirely seperate of from the data's area of concern.
The MVC decomposition is was a natural evolution in software stemming from design by
seperation of responsibility and the development of graphical user interfaces.

The parts tracking database uses a MVC framework known as Backbone.js. Backbone provides
base Model, View, and Collection objects with APIs designed for use together. Some of the
API is borrowed from another useful toolkit known as Underscore.js. The Backbone Model 
object has a set of attributes (defined by the developer) which are interacted with through
built in getters and setters which take an attribute key or key-value JSON object literal,
respectively. When an attribute is changed, the model fires a change event, which is picked
up by any View objects listening to that model.

The Backbone View, in turn, will refresh UI on a model change. The view contains a render
method which updates the HTML on the page. The view object also contain logic and functions
for interactions with the DOM. Though a view has a reference to the model object it represents,
the link may only be used for querying model state. Not allowing the view to directly manipulate
the model is an important aspect of MVC decomposition. Instead, to change a model's state the
view will notify a Collection object which contains a related set of Model objects.

Backbone's Collection class is a flexible container for Model objects and makes great use
of the Underscore.js library methods. In addition, the Backbone.Events API has been extended
to singletone Collections in the PTDB, and this is how views may communicate via messages
with the models they represent. In this fashion the Collection objects play the role of
the controller in MVC decomposition. In terms of design patterns, the Collection singletons 
act as mediators between the views and models, or models and other models.

By using the mediator patter, models are decoupled from other models or views and the
appliction is easier to maintain and extend. Very little work is requried on the 
developer's behalf as Backbone.Events does the heavy lifting, and extending the Events
API onto an object provides an easy way to create a mediator-type object. 

Besides Backbone.js (which uses Underscore.js), the PTDB also takes advantage of JQuery,
a popular JavaScript library which simplifies interactions with the DOM and also provides
AJAX abilities. Extensions to JQuery which deal specifically with CouchDB are also used.
JQuery provides a lightweight but powerful API for document manipulation, in contrast to
using pure JavaScript methods alone.

For a refined user experience, Twitter's Bootstrap styling package is used. Bootstrap 
provides HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript (not used in the PTDB) for building a clean
user interface with forms, buttons, and navigation components. Using a popular UI 
library allows application development to focus on functionality rather than style (and
cross-browser styling) issues.

\subsubsection{PTDB Structure Detail}
The tracking logic (linking relatives, assembly components, and history entries) are controlled
with two objects, RecordCollection and HistoryCollection. The Backbone.Events API has been
extended onto these objects and they act as singleton mediators between part/assembly/history 
models and are also notified with events from views.

These two objects are the controllers of the PTDB, and the Backbone API has been extended
for ease of use. Extra options can be passed to the get method of these collections which
specify whether to automatically open a record from the database, or whether to open a view
for presenting a model to the user. A factory method on the collection examines the JSON
fetched from CouchDB and creates an instance of the correct type, adding the new model
to the collection.

The model types stored in these collections are PartRecords/AssemblyRecords or HistoryRecords
respectively. The attributes of these models point to instances of another type of Collection,
the FormCollection. As the goal of the PTDB is to present a rich interface for data entry, forms
themselves have model and view representations. The simplest type of form is a textbox and label 
pair. The Form model stores data about the object -- its current value, the label and tooltip text,
and a boolean value representing whether or not the model is valid.

More complex forms include dropdown boxes which contain options pulled from CouchDB. The model
stores a reference to the correct type of options for the dropdown list. In addition, if the 
desired option is not present the form can be switched into a textbox. The value entered by
the user is sanitized and a key is generated based on the sanitized value. The new key-value
pair is then written to the database and is present for future use.

This database-active dropdown object is exploited for lists of locations (with address meta-data
stored in the database record), processes, or collaboration members. No administrative intervention
is required for the addition of information to these lists. To improve performance and reduce
AJAX requests the options lists are cached in an object which specifies a few-second timeout.
If many records are opened at once and they contain multiple DB-active dropdown lists, they 
pull data from the cached list object rather than sending out AJAX requests and waiting for 
a response.

Another type of form used is a list of records. 
In the Couch JSON record, lists of relatives or linked histories are simply arrays of database ids. To provide a rich
interface for the user, the RecordList encapsultes a Collection of record values (names, dates, etc...)
as well as methods for adding/removing records from the list. Data for the collection is not loaded
until interaction with the view to improve performance when multiple record models are opened.

Data validation is handled by a singleton (Validator) and the Backbone.Model validate API. The validate
method of model objects delegates to Validator by passing the values to be validated to the correct
Validator method. A regular expression test is done and the result returned. The Validator singleton
allows for all regular expressions for validation to be present in a single object, reducing scattered
regex patterns in the application. Invalid data triggers view notifcation and can, for instance, turn backgrounds 
red to notify the user that something has gone wrong. Invalid data can prevent record saving, or relative/history linking.

As mentioned previously, queries to CouchDB are handled through views which are implementations of an
incremental MapReduce on the data. The PTDB presents a few different search types to users including
part serial number, name, comments, linked history records, material type, or machining operations.
The machining operations search requires a Majorana drawing number which may be a partial match. Data
returned from a Couch view is used to instantiate a SearchResults collection which implements various
sorting features.

Besides directly manipulating a single record, a user may also open multiple records at once for 
manipulation. Controlled by the MultipleSelect model, users may batch-add history entries to a
large number of parts and greatly reduce their workload. This interactivity is available from
the view displaying search results.

A user may also wish to copy data present in an existing part into one or more new parts. This
feature is called cloning and is implemented through a general operation which accepts the number
of clones to be made. Any data and history entries present in the original part are present in the
clones produced, and history entries are re-linked to the new clones such that the clone serial
numbers appear in the history entries' linked records data. If an assembly component is cloned, the
resulting clones will not be a member of the assembly (as this requires component roles and positions
to be specified) but they will have the data present from the original part.

What features am I missing that should be detailed?

\subsubsection{python exp calc structure}

In addition to the PTDB web application for data entry, we have created a Python program for
examining records in the database and calculating activation rates based on storage and 
transportation times and locations. The exposure calculator can crawl the database or can
also be run in server mode, using the Twisted library, and accepts http requests for
exposure data. The locations record in the database contains address meta-data which
is geocoded and time sampled using the Google Maps API. Elevation and time data can
then be used to calculate expected activation rates for a given transportation route
or storage event.

Twisted is an event-driven network layer which can use many networking protocols. We've 
choosen to use its HTTP functionality and and return exposure data as JSON strings. By
using Twisted, our application gets multi-threaded concurrency for free. As developers,
we simply write callback functions for the appropriate request URI.

As it is not possible to send a GPS system with every shipment of experiment components
in Majorana, we must make due with shipping information and origin/destination information.
Given the origin and destination locations, we use the Google Maps API to generate time
sampled geocodes (latitude, longtitude, and elevation). The elevation data is then used
to calculation partial exposure to cosmic raditation. The total exposure for a given
transportation or storage event is then simply the sum of the sampled exposures.

Because more than one part may be linked to a history event, the calculated exposure is
stored in the storage/transportation records, along with a calculation timestamp, or a flag
if something has gone wrong during calculation. When not operating in server mode, the Python
exposure calculator crawls the history records of the database and calculates exposure for
new history entries or if a particular entry's timestamp is out of date.
